# Proposal: Analysis of Premier League Match Data (2021-2022)

## 1. Dataset Description  
The dataset contains match-level statistics from the 2021-2022 Premier League season, covering team performance, match outcomes, and key events. It includes numerical variables like goals, shots, and fouls, as well as categorical variables such as match results and team names.  

### Provenance  
- Source: [Premier League Official Data / Public Repository]  
- Data type: Structured match-level records  
- Dimensions: Match data, teams, scores, results, offensive and defensive stats  

## 2. Reason for Choosing the Dataset  
The Premier League is one of the most competitive football leagues, making this dataset ideal for analyzing game patterns, team strategies, and match outcomes. The combination of numerical and categorical data allows for meaningful statistical analysis and visualization.  

## 3. Research Questions  

### How does shot accuracy impact match results?  
- Examining the relationship between shots on target and match outcomes.  
- Comparing shot accuracy of winning and losing teams.  

### How does disciplinary record (fouls and cards) correlate with match outcomes?  
- Analyzing how fouls and cards affect a teamâ€™s performance.  
- Comparing match results between aggressive and disciplined teams.  

## 4. Plan for Analysis  

For shot accuracy, we will calculate the ratio of shots on target to total shots and analyze whether teams with higher accuracy have better results. Scatter plots and comparisons across match outcomes will help visualize trends.  

For disciplinary records, we will examine how fouls and cards influence a team's chances of winning. Bar charts and heatmaps will highlight differences between aggressive and disciplined teams.  

To provide deeper insights, external data such as league standings can be merged to compare stats with final rankings, or possession statistics can be used to see if aggressive teams have lower ball control.
