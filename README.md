# Project 1 – Premier League Match Data Analysis (COMP4010)

This is the first project for COMP4010: Data Visualization. We analyze the 2021–2022 Premier League season to identify the least attractive team playstyle and underperforming players who should be sold. Using match-level and player-level statistics, we apply visual and statistical methods to uncover inefficiencies and generate actionable insights for team management.
